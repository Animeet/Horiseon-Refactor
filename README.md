# <Horiseon-Refactor>

## Description

 I had to take what was already made and:
 - Create a new repository to work on the project within
 - Upload/Transfer all of the information, code, and files to the repository to properly be able to work
 - Refactor parts of the code that didn't meet accessibility standards
 - Deploy the project for submission  

I learned, and refreshed myself on how to start from the basics of creating a repo, up to filling in all of the pieces to get this project deployed.
Now the webpage is all deployed and ready!

## Usage

This webpage can be used as the primary landing page for Horiseon. When someone is interested in what Horiseon has to offer, you can find everything that they have to offer right on this front page.
It's a clean page with all of the necessary information needed for interested parties to be satisfied.

## License

Through both the Module description, and the information under 02-Challenge, I did not see any mention of needing to include a license to this repository.
Our lessons throughout the week never included us adding a License. Though, the prework-study-guide had us include a standard MIT License.

I can add a License if need be, but will follow the directions given, and not include extra things that were not asked of me.
